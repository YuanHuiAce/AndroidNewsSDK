ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

 * Project
   ShareSDK:/Users/fiocca/Downloads/ShareSDK-Android-2.8.3-a1cc201b1a39082db9194
   abcb08dbc62/ShareSDK for Android/Libs/MainLibs/.classpath:
   Could not resolve source path src in project ShareSDK: ignored. The project
   may not compile if the given source path provided source code.


Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* build.xml
* proguard-project.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => shareSDK/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* libs/MobCommons-2017.0412.1554.jar => shareSDK/libs/MobCommons-2017.0412.1554.jar
* libs/MobTools-2017.0412.1554.jar => shareSDK/libs/MobTools-2017.0412.1554.jar
* libs/ShareSDK-Core-2.8.3.jar => shareSDK/libs/ShareSDK-Core-2.8.3.jar
* libs/ShareSDK-QQ-2.8.3.jar => shareSDK/libs/ShareSDK-QQ-2.8.3.jar
* libs/ShareSDK-SinaWeibo-2.8.3.jar => shareSDK/libs/ShareSDK-SinaWeibo-2.8.3.jar
* libs/ShareSDK-Wechat-2.8.3.jar => shareSDK/libs/ShareSDK-Wechat-2.8.3.jar
* libs/ShareSDK-Wechat-Core-2.8.3.jar => shareSDK/libs/ShareSDK-Wechat-Core-2.8.3.jar
* libs/ShareSDK-Wechat-Favorite-2.8.3.jar => shareSDK/libs/ShareSDK-Wechat-Favorite-2.8.3.jar
* libs/ShareSDK-Wechat-Moments-2.8.3.jar => shareSDK/libs/ShareSDK-Wechat-Moments-2.8.3.jar
* res/ => shareSDK/src/main/res/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
